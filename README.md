##webpack-changed-vendor-plugin

Do you use a file hash in front of every chunk? This plugin will output the same vendor hash every time until the assets inside of it actually change. This is useful if you want to keep your vendor from being updated if nothing has changed inside of it.

This isn't done yet. Should be in a few days
